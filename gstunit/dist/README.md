# GSTUNIT

## Gosilang Translation Unit

GSTUNIT is a Python package designed to facilitate translation between the Gosi programming language and other languages. It serves as a translation unit specifically tailored for Gosi, enabling developers to seamlessly convert code written in Gosi to other languages and vice versa.

### Features

- Translation of Gosi programming language constructs to various target languages.
- Support for translating code snippets, scripts, and larger Gosi projects.
- Seamless integration with existing Python workflows.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of GSTUNIT is to bridge the gap between Gosi and other programming languages, facilitating interoperability and enabling developers to leverage the strengths of both Gosi and other languages. By providing a reliable translation unit, GSTUNIT aims to enhance the development experience for Gosi programmers and enable them to collaborate more effectively with developers working in other languages.

### Translation Capabilities

GSTUNIT currently focuses on translating Gosi code into the Ndebe script of the Igbo language. This allows Gosi developers to write code using familiar syntax and conventions while producing output that can be understood by speakers of the Ndebe dialect of Igbo.

### Setup

To use GSTUNIT, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**:

   ```bash
   pip install gstunit
   ```

2. Usage:

After installing GSTUNIT, you can import it into your Python projects and use its translation capabilities:

```py
import gstunit

# Example usage
translated_code = gstunit.translate_gosi_to_ndebe(gosi_code)
print(translated_code)
```
